An FPGA-based Data Acquisition System for Directional Dark Matter Detection

I. Introduction
	
	-Directional dark matter detection seeks to reconstruct the angular distribution of dark matter particles traveling through the 
	labratory.

	-This paper describes an FPGA-based digital BE system to handle a 16 Gbps data stream from 1000 different independent detector
	channels sampled at 1 MHz.

	-We are trying to detect the evidence of an interaction between a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) and a target nucleus.
	The interaction is an elastic collision that creates a recoiling nucleus. 

	-This collisions occur within a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) in which a nuclear recoil generates a track of ionization that is 
	drifted to a readout plane using a uniform magnetic field.


II. Detection Scheme and Physics Requirements

	-A WIMP may enter the TPC and interact with a fluorine nucleus of a SF6 molecule, generating a fluroine nucleus recoil.
	As the nucleus comes to rest, 	it generates a track of ionization electrons. The high electronegative SF6 gas will readily 
	attach the free elections, forming SF6-. This track of these ions then drifts under an applied electric field toward the 
	readout strips. There are 500 strips in the x and 500 strips in the y directions.

	-From the charge signal, we can reconstruct the recoil energy and track of the geometry of the event. The recoil energy
	is determined from the total deposited charge in the detector. The different in arrival time between the species at the
	readout plane is directly proportional to the total drift distance.
